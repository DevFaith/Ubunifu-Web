<h1>Do you think you belong here?</h1>
<p>Over the past 100 years, alot of areas in life have been revolutionized but education is not one of them. <br>Historically, higher education has avoided competitive disruption. One reason for this past immunity is <br>the power of prestige in the higher education marketplace, where the quality of the product is hard to <br>measure. At Ubunifu Our focus is to graduate all students innovation ready, ready to solve problems <br>creatively.
